## How to use (for collaborators)

The 'get prediction grid' script should be run before running other
scripts. Use the 'pull data' file or go to the 'data' folder to get the
data we are working with then run the 'main' file. Other scripts provide
supporting functions that are run in the 'main' file. Due to the high
number of species, effort scenarios, and replicates, the script is very
computationally intensive. Reduce the number of species/effort
scenarios/replicates when testing.
